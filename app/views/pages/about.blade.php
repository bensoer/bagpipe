            <p class="text-left">Music is part of everyones life and day, and Youtube has become the main influence
            of our exploration of music. Bagpipe choses to harness that influence by creating an interface for you to
            create your playlists for parties or social events.</p>
            <p class="text-left">No need to hire a DJ, just create a playlist on Bagpipe.
            If your guests would like to contribute to the playlist, simply share your playlist pin and others can submit
            songs to your playlist. The more votes a song gets, the higher up the playlist it moves!</p>
